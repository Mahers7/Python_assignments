# DNA Sequence Analyzer
This Python program provides functionality to analyze DNA sequences from files in FASTA or GenBank format. It includes tools to find the longest repeated sub-sequence and the longest contiguous GC combination sequence within a DNA sequence.

# To find the Longest Repeated Sub-sequence
Run:
```python analyze.py sequence.fasta --duplicate```

# To find the Longest GC Combination Sequence
Run:
```python analyze.py sequence.fasta --gc_long```


# Requirements needed to run the program:
```pip install requirements.txt```
