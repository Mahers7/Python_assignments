The data in the Excel file (rnaseq.xlsx) is a subset from an RNA seq dataset collected from a post doc student in our lab. Half of the data consists of real values, while the other half consists of fake data. The dataset describes RNA sequencing (RNA Seq) analysis the transcriptome in DRG (Dorsal Root Ganglion) cells, categorized into naive and injured states.

The file `rna_seq_analysis.py` show the following computations:
Calculates the mean and standard deviation (SD) of expression levels for naive cells and injured cells.
